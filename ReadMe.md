AnomaData (Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance)
Problem Statement
Many different industries need predictive maintenance solutions to reduce risks and gain actionable insights through processing data from their equipment. The goal of this project is to predict machine breakdowns by identifying anomalies in the data.

Capstone Project Overview
This Capstone project involves predicting machine breakdowns by identifying anomalies in the data using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains over 18,000 rows collected over a few days. The column y contains binary labels with 1 denoting an anomaly, while the rest of the columns are predictors.


Train/Test Split - Apply a sampling distribution to find the best split.
Choose the metrics for model evaluation.
Model Selection, Training, Predicting, and Assessment.
Hyperparameter Tuning/Model Improvement.
Key Steps
Step 1: Data Collection
Dataset: Anoma_data.csv
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand the Dataset:
Shape, summary statistics, missing values, and data types.
Visualize the Data:
Distribution of the target variable (y), correlation heatmap, and feature distributions.
Check for Duplicates:
Remove duplicate rows if present.
Step 3: Data Cleaning
Handle Missing Values:
Fill or drop missing values in the dataset.
Standardize Data Types:
Convert date columns to datetime type and categorical columns to category.
Remove Duplicates:
Drop duplicate rows.
Normalize or Scale Data:
Scale numerical features if necessary.
Step 4: Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
Create New Features:
Interactions, date features, and transformations.
Feature Selection:
Use correlation analysis and model importance to select the best features.
Step 5: Train-Test Split and Model Selection
Split the Data:
Divide into training and test sets.
Model Selection:
Choose models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, or XGBoost.
Model Evaluation:
Accuracy, confusion matrix, and AUC-ROC curve.
Step 6: Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Improvement
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Model Improvement:
Further feature engineering, model selection, and ensemble methods.
